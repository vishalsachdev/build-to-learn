In the age of AI, learning is no longer just about consuming information—it’s about building artifacts that demonstrate understanding, creativity, and applied skill. This session explores how faculty and instructional designers can adopt a builder mindset using AI tools, and how that same approach enables students to take on larger, more meaningful challenges.

​The conversation will focus on learning by building—where projects, prototypes, and AI-assisted outputs become central to the learning process—and building to learn, where the act of creation deepens understanding. Participants will see how AI can support this shift by accelerating ideation, enabling experimentation, and helping learners create portfolio-ready artifacts that reflect their learning journey.

​This session is designed for faculty and instructional designers who want hands-on, applied workflows they can use immediately in their courses and learning design work.
​
​This will be a highly interactive session. I will demo selected AI-powered building workflows in real time and invite participants to follow along during a guided building activity. 

Attendees will collaboratively create and share their work in a common canvas or shared Google Doc, turning the session into an active, participatory learning experience rather than a passive talk.
