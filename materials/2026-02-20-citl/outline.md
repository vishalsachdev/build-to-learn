## Slide 2: The Problem (NEW - Critical for Ad Context)

**"In an AI-first world, traditional quality signals are broken"**

- Tests? AI can pass them
- Papers? AI can write them
- Projects? AI can build them
- Grades? AI can game them

**The question isn't "How do we ban AI?"**

It's: **"How do we create new quality signals that can't be automated?"**

Answer: Building real things, deploying them publicly, iterating based on feedback.

---

## Slide 3: The Shift

YESTERDAY
- Assessments AI can game
- Instructors deliver content
- Students consume
- Shrinking attention spans

TODAY
- Projects requiring agency + judgment
- Instructors BUILD tools (and teach their students to)
- Students CREATE things that matter
- Curiosity & ownership

---

## Slide 4: The Arc

🔧 You become builders
↓
🎓 You teach building
↓
🚀 Students take on larger, more meaningful challenges

"Not by banning AI, but by making creation the default."

---

## Slide 5: Why Building Works (3 Principles)

**Agency**
When you build something real, you own it. Ownership drives engagement.

**Iteration**
Learning happens through: attempt → feedback → refinement
(Not "get it right the first time")

**Curiosity**
Building something real sparks questions that worksheets never will.
Students ask "What else could I build?" instead of "When is this due?"

---

## Slide 6: Building Deepens Understanding (NEW - Epistemology)

**Building ≠ Applying Knowledge**

Building REVEALS what you don't know.

- When you sketch an idea, you find the gaps
- When you build it, edge cases emerge
- When users try it, assumptions break
- When you iterate, you integrate understanding

**The paradox**: Building is slower than lecturing, but learning is deeper.

Because understanding isn't transfer. It's construction.

---

## Slide 7-11: Mental Models (Reordered by Importance to Ad)

### Slide 7: Theory of Mind for AI

"The skill that makes you great at AI isn't technical. It's social."
— Riedl & Weidmann, "Quantifying Human-AI Synergy" (2025)

Your capacity to model another agent's beliefs, goals, and perspective.

When you get a bad response, ask:
- "What false assumption is the AI making?"
- "What context am I taking for granted?"

Your job: **Be the bridge** between intent ↔ AI's understanding

**Example**: Don't say "make a quiz." Say "make a 5-question formative quiz for 4th graders who just learned fractions, include one trick question, and show the answer after they submit."

---

### Slide 8: Context Engineering > Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering = wordsmithing (magic phrases, tricks)

**Context engineering = making tacit knowledge explicit**

You don't need to learn prompting tricks.
You need to translate: 
- Course level / modality
- What you covered
- What didn't work before
- Constraints and edge cases
- Who your audience is

**This skill transfers everywhere.** Not dependent on Claude or ChatGPT.

---

### Slide 9: Problem First, Tool Second (NEW - From Teaching Philosophy)

**The difference between a tool students use and a tool students care about:**

| Tool as Template | Tool as Solution to Your Pain |
|---|---|
| "Make a flashcard app" | "I spend 20 min/week organizing a concept glossary for students with varied preparation" |
| Generic | Specific |
| One iteration | 10 iterations |
| Forgotten after class | Used for months |

**Your job today**: Identify YOUR pain point.
Not what's on this list. What's YOURS?

"What would make my teaching life easier?"
"What do my students struggle with?"
"What takes too long?"

Then build THAT.

---

### Slide 10: The Three Stances

**Stance 1**: Don't know the domain → AI gives garbage mixed with gold, can't tell which

**Stance 2**: Know domain, resist adapting → Only time savings on rote tasks

**Stance 3**: Know domain + collaborate creatively → **DRAMATIC amplification**

You are domain experts in learning.

Today we move you to Stance 3.

---

### Slide 11: Architect, Not Coder

You describe what you/students need.
The AI builds it.

Your expertise: **Pedagogy**
AI's expertise: **Code**

Never let "I can't code" stop you.

You're not a coder today. You're a designer translating needs into specifications.

---

### Slide 12: Public Deployment = Accountability = Learning (NEW)

**Why Netlify Drop (or any public URL) is non-negotiable:**

| Local Only | Public URL |
|---|---|
| "Let me fix this later" | "People will use this next week" |
| No stakes | Stakes create rigor |
| Shame in iteration | Iteration is normal |
| Invisible learning | **Visible growth** (v1 → v2 → v3) |

When you deploy publicly:
1. You notice problems you missed
2. Real feedback comes from actual users
3. You iterate with urgency
4. Your version history shows learning

**For your students**: This becomes your portfolio. Not grades. Not credentials. Real work people used.

**Netlify Drop** = drag & drop, live in seconds. **GitHub Pages** = permanence (great follow-up at home).

---

### Slide 13: Iterate, Don't Perfect

Your first output won't be right.
That's expected and good.

Don't try to craft the perfect prompt upfront.

Instead: **Describe what's wrong with what you got.**

This is exactly how professionals work with AI.

Version 1 is a starting point, not a failure.

---

## Slide 14: LIVE DEMO

Examples: Mental Models in Action

[FACILITATOR: Demo your 2-3 pre-built artifacts here, showing the problem they solved + the prompt evolution + how you iterated + where users gave feedback]

Make these REAL projects you use, not generic examples.

---

## Slide 15: Your Tools

Excalidraw → Google AI Studio → Netlify Drop

Each tool has a purpose. You're not learning software. You're moving through a workflow.

---

## Slide 16: The Flow

STEP 1: Excalidraw
- Sketch your idea
- Low stakes
- Visual brainstorm

↓

STEP 2: AI Studio
- Make it real
- Iterate with chat
- See live preview

↓

STEP 3: Netlify Drop
- Drag & drop your HTML file
- Live URL in seconds
- app.netlify.com/drop

---

## Slide 17: Sketch First (Two Options)

**Option A: Excalidraw (Digital)**
- excalidraw.com
- Sketch boxes, buttons, text
- Export as PNG

**Option B: Paper + Phone**
- Sketch on paper
- Take a photo with your phone
- Upload directly to AI Studio

Both work equally well — AI Studio accepts any image.

---

## Slide 17b: Screenshot + Remix (Fastest Path)

For people who struggle to ideate from scratch:

1. **Screenshot** any website, PDF, app, or tool you like
2. **Paste** into Excalidraw (or upload directly)
3. **Annotate** with text: "Change this to X", "Add Y here"
4. **Upload** to AI Studio — it creates your customized version

**Why this works:**
- No blank page problem — you have a starting point
- Shows the AI exactly what you want
- Your annotations = your customizations
- Output: single HTML+JS page you can publish via Netlify Drop

---

## Slide 18: BUILD SESSION 1: Three Ways to Start

**8 minutes to sketch**

### Path 1: Screenshot + Remix (FASTEST)
Best for: "I want something like THIS but for MY class"
1. Screenshot a website, PDF, or app you like
2. Paste into Excalidraw
3. Add text annotations: "change this", "add that"
4. Upload to AI Studio

### Path 2: Pick a Template
Best for: "I know what I need"
- 📚 Vocabulary flashcards
- 🎲 Random student picker
- ⏰ Activity timer
- ✅ Quick formative quiz
- 📝 Exit ticket

### Path 3: Solve Your Pain Point
Best for: "I have a specific problem"
- What takes too long?
- What do students struggle with?
- What's tedious every week?

**All outputs: Single HTML+JS page → publish via Netlify Drop in seconds.**

---

## Slide 19: BUILD SESSION 2: Make It Real

**40-45 minutes in AI Studio**

The Workflow:

1. Export Excalidraw sketch as PNG
2. Open aistudio.google.com (Chat mode — the default)
3. Paste image + describe what you want
4. **Iterate in plain English**

Example iteration prompts:
- "Make the button bigger"
- "Add a score counter"
- "Change colors to match my school"
- "Make it work on mobile"
- "The quiz isn't randomizing—it should show 5 random questions"

### Remember: Use Your Mental Models

When something isn't working:
- "What context is the AI missing?" (Theory of Mind)
- "What assumption is it making?" (Context Engineering)
- Be the bridge between your intent and the AI's output

---

## Slide 20: Deploy & Share (NEW - Critical to Ad Promise)

**Before we wrap, push your work live.**

**Netlify Drop (instant — do this now):**
1. Copy the HTML code from AI Studio
2. Save as `index.html` on your computer
3. Go to [app.netlify.com/drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop)
4. Drag and drop your file
5. Your app is live! Copy the URL.

This isn't just saving your work.
You've created a **portfolio piece**.
Something real. Something deployed. Something users can access.

This is the new quality signal.

**GitHub Pages (for permanence — take-home step):**
Create a repo, upload your `index.html`, enable Pages → free hosting forever at username.github.io/repo-name.

---

## Slide 21: The Multiplier Effect

**You just built something in 1 hour.**

Now imagine your students doing this.

If you teach 30 students to be builders, and each creates one tool:
- 30 new learning resources that didn't exist before
- Created by the people who need them most
- Deployed publicly with iteration visible
- Portfolio pieces, not assignments

**Larger, more meaningful challenges** emerge from this foundation.

Once students can build and deploy tools:
- They can tackle authentic problems
- They can iterate based on real feedback
- They own their learning

---

## Slide 22: For Students: Same Principles

**Agency**
When you build your own study tools, you own your learning.

**Iteration**
"Fix what's wrong" beats "get it right the first time."

**Curiosity**
"What else could I build?" becomes the driving question.

---

## Slide 23: Your Next Step

### Right Now:

**Find an accountability partner**
Find someone here who will check in with you.

**This week:**
Post your portfolio URL in the shared doc
[[SHARED_DOC_LINK]]

### In the next 2 weeks:

Pick ONE lesson in your course where students **BUILD instead of CONSUME**.
([[SHARED_DOC_LINK]])

Just one. Start there.

Then you'll see the multiplier effect.

---

## Slide 24: Collaborative Share (NEW - From Ad Promise)

**Let's see what you built.**

Spend 10 minutes:
1. Share your portfolio URL in the shared doc
   - [[SHARED_DOC_LINK]]
2. Explore what others built
3. Leave one comment on someone else's tool (What did you notice? What's clever? What would you ask them to build next?)

This is the feedback loop. This is how learning happens.

---

## Slide 26: Exit Ticket

💡 **One thing that clicked for you**

❓ **One thing still fuzzy**

🚀 **What will you build in the next 2 weeks?** (Pick your pain point.)

---

## Slide 27: Closing

"Not by banning AI, but by making creation the default."

You've experienced the loop today:
- Build (your tool)
- Present (share your URL)
- Feedback (see what others made)
- Iterate (you know how now)

Now go teach this to your students.

Go build something that matters.

Thank you.
