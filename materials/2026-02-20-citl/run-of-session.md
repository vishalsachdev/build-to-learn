## Detailed Facilitator Guide

### 0:00-0:03 — Welcome & The Shift (3 min)

**Key message:** This is about a fundamental shift from instructors as content deliverers to instructors as builders.

**Say:**
> "Welcome everyone. Today's workshop is about a fundamental shift. By the end of this hour, you'll have built something real that you can use in your next class session."

**Show:** Yesterday vs Today comparison

---

### 0:03-0:07 — The Arc & Why Building Works (4 min)

**Key message:** You become builders → You teach building → Students become creators

**Emphasize the quote:**
> "Not by banning AI, but by making creation the default."

**Three principles to highlight:**
1. **Agency** — ownership drives engagement
2. **Iteration** — attempt → feedback → refinement
3. **Curiosity** — building sparks real questions

---

### 0:07-0:15 — Mental Models (8 min)

**This is the conceptual foundation. Don't rush.**

**Key concepts:**
1. **Theory of Mind for AI** — "What false assumption is the AI making?"
2. **Context Engineering** — It's about what info you include, not clever phrasing
3. **The Three Stances** — Move them to Stance 3 (domain expert + creative collaboration)
4. **Architect, Not Coder** — "Never let 'I can't code' stop you"
5. **Iterate, Don't Perfect** — First prompt won't be right, that's expected

**Bridge example to use:**
> "If I ask AI to 'make a quiz for my students,' it doesn't know the course level & modality, what we just covered, whether it's formative or summative, or what accessibility + accommodations are in play."

---

### 0:15-0:18 — Live Demo (3 min)

**Show 1-2 pre-built artifacts:**
- Walk through the prompt evolution
- Show how iteration improved the result
- Keep it quick — they'll learn by doing

---

### 0:18-0:22 — Your Tools (4 min)

**The flow:**
1. **Excalidraw** (https://excalidraw.com/) — Sketch your idea
2. **AI Studio** (aistudio.google.com) — Make it real
3. **Netlify Drop** (app.netlify.com/drop) — Publish instantly

**Have them open Excalidraw NOW:**
> "Open https://excalidraw.com/ right now. Don't wait."

---

### 0:20-0:28 — BUILD SESSION 1: Three Ways to Start (8 min)

**⏱️ Set a visible timer**

**Emphasize the three paths:**

1. **Screenshot + Remix (FASTEST)** — Best for "I want something like THIS but for MY class"
   - Screenshot any website, PDF, or app you like
   - Paste into Excalidraw (or upload directly)
   - Add text annotations: "change this to X", "add Y here"

2. **Pick a Template** — Best for "I know what I need"
   - Vocabulary flashcards
   - Random student picker
   - Activity timer
   - Quick formative quiz
   - Exit ticket

3. **Solve Your Pain Point** — Best for "I have a specific problem"
   - What takes too long?
   - What do students struggle with?

**Sketching options:**
- Digital: Excalidraw (excalidraw.com)
- Paper: Sketch on paper, take a photo, upload to AI Studio

**Circulate and help:**
- If stuck: "What website or app do you already like? Screenshot it!"
- "Ugly is fine — the AI will make it pretty"
- "Don't overthink — you can always build more later"

**At 7 min:** "One more minute to wrap up!"

---

### 0:28-0:43 — BUILD SESSION 2: Make It Real (15 min)

**⏱️ Set a visible timer**

**Instructions:**
1. Upload your image (screenshot, Excalidraw PNG, or paper photo)
2. Open aistudio.google.com (Chat mode — the default)
3. Paste image + describe what you want
4. Iterate!

**Output:** Single HTML+JS page → publish instantly via Netlify Drop (app.netlify.com/drop).

**Iteration prompts to suggest:**
- "Make the button bigger"
- "Add a score counter"
- "Change colors to match my school"
- "Make it work on mobile"
- "The [X] isn't working — it should [expected behavior]"

**Circulate and coach:**
- Remind them of Theory of Mind: "What context is the AI missing?"
- Encourage iteration: "What's wrong with it? Tell the AI."
- Celebrate progress: "That's working! What's next?"

**Time checks:**
- At 7 min: "Halfway! How's everyone doing?"
- At 12 min: "3 more minutes!"
- At 14 min: "Start wrapping up — get it to a good stopping point"

---

### 0:50-0:55 — The Multiplier & For Students (5 min)

**Key message:** Scale the impact

**Say:**
> "You just built something in an hour. Now imagine your students doing this. If you teach 30 students to be builders, and each creates one tool, that's 30 new learning resources that didn't exist before."

**Same principles apply to students:**
- Agency → they own their learning
- Iteration → "fix what's wrong" beats "get it right first time"
- Curiosity → "what else could I build?"

---

### 0:55-0:58 — For Faculty & Resources (3 min)

**Commitment:**
> "Pick ONE class session or module in the next 2 weeks where students BUILD instead of consume."

**Right now actions:**
1. Find an accountability partner (turn to someone near you)
2. Post your app URL in the shared doc: [[SHARED_DOC_LINK]]

**Resources:**
- https://excalidraw.com/
- aistudio.google.com
- AI Studio → App Gallery
- grow.google/ai-for-educators

---

### 0:58-1:00 — Exit Ticket & Close (2 min)

**Three questions:**
1. 💡 One thing that clicked
2. ❓ One thing still fuzzy
3. 🚀 What will you build in the next 2 weeks of your course?

**Close with:**
> "Now go build something. Thank you for being here today. I can't wait to see what you create — and what your students create after you teach them."

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **"I don't know what to build"** | "What website or app do you already use? Screenshot it and tell the AI what to change!" |
| **Stuck on ideation** | Push screenshot+remix path — it eliminates blank page problem |
| **Participant stuck on sketching** | "Paper sketch + phone photo works too!" |
| **AI Studio not working** | Try describing instead of image upload |
| **Too many ideas** | "Pick the smallest one — you can build more later" |
| **Running behind** | Cut demo time, extend build time |
| **Running ahead** | Add share-out time at end |
