## 9. Goals/Objectives

After attending this session participants will know about **how AI tools can shift learning from consumption to creation through a sketch-to-deployment workflow** and be able to **build and deploy a functional web-based teaching tool using free AI tools—without writing code**.

## 10. Short Session Abstract (100 words)

In an AI-first world, traditional assessments can be gamed. This hands-on workshop introduces a new paradigm: building to learn. Participants will experience a complete sketch-to-deployment workflow using free tools (Excalidraw, Google AI Studio, Netlify Drop) to create a functional teaching tool in under an hour—no coding required. You'll leave with a deployed portfolio piece and practical mental models for AI collaboration: theory of mind, context engineering, and problem-first design. Most importantly, you'll gain a framework for helping students tackle larger, more meaningful challenges by making creation the default mode of learning.

## 11. Session Outline/Description (500 words)

**Opening: The Problem (5 min)**
We'll begin by examining why traditional quality signals in education—tests, papers, projects—are increasingly unreliable in an AI-first world. The question isn't "How do we ban AI?" but rather "How do we create new quality signals that can't be automated?" The answer: building real things, deploying them publicly, and iterating based on feedback.

**Mental Models for AI Collaboration (10 min)**
Participants will learn three practical frameworks:
- **Theory of Mind for AI**: Understanding that effective AI collaboration isn't a technical skill—it's a social one. When you get a poor response, ask "What assumption is the AI making?" and "What context am I taking for granted?"
- **Context Engineering**: Moving beyond "prompt tricks" to making tacit knowledge explicit—course level, audience, constraints, and what hasn't worked before.
- **Problem First, Tool Second**: The difference between tools students use once and tools they use for months is whether they solve a genuine pain point.

**Live Demo (5 min)**
I'll demonstrate 2-3 teaching tools I've built using this workflow, showing the problem each solved, how I iterated through multiple versions, and how real user feedback shaped improvements.

**Hands-On Build Session (25 min)**
Participants will build their own tool using three entry paths:

1. **Screenshot + Remix (Fastest)** - Take a screenshot of any website, PDF, or app you like, paste it into Excalidraw (or upload directly), annotate with what you want changed, and let AI build your customized version. This eliminates the "blank page" problem.

2. **Pick a Template** - Choose from starter ideas: vocabulary flashcards, random student picker, activity timer, formative quiz, or exit ticket.

3. **Solve Your Pain Point** - Identify what takes too long, what students struggle with, or what's tedious every week—then build that.

Participants can sketch digitally (Excalidraw) or on paper (photo upload). AI Studio accepts any image. The output is a single HTML+JS page published instantly via Netlify Drop.

**Share & Feedback (5 min)**
Participants share their deployed URLs in a collaborative document, explore what others built, and leave brief feedback. This models the iteration loop we want students to experience.

**Takeaways & Next Steps**
Participants leave with:
- A deployed teaching tool they built themselves
- A repeatable workflow (Sketch → AI Studio Chat mode → Netlify Drop)
- Mental models for effective AI collaboration
- A framework for designing student assignments around building
- Accountability partners and a shared resource document

**Templates and Resources Shared:**
- Slide deck with workflow diagrams
- Starter prompt templates for common teaching tools
- Links to free tools and tutorials
- Shared collaborative document for ongoing community sharing
