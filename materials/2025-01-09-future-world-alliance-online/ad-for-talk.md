In the age of AI, learning is no longer just about consuming information—it’s about building artifacts that demonstrate understanding, creativity, and applied skill. This session explores how educators can adopt a builder mindset using AI tools, and how that same approach enables students to take on larger, more meaningful challenges.

​The conversation will focus on learning by building—where projects, prototypes, and AI-assisted outputs become central to the learning process—and building to learn, where the act of creation deepens understanding. Participants will see how AI can support this shift by accelerating ideation, enabling experimentation, and helping learners create portfolio-ready artifacts that reflect their learning journey.

​This session is designed for educators, builders, and students who are interested in hands-on, applied learning models and who want to move beyond theory into practice.
​
​This will be a highly interactive session. I will demo selected AI-powered building workflows in real time and invite participants to follow along during a guided building activity. 

Attendees will collaboratively create and share their work in a common canvas or shared Google Doc, turning the session into an active, participatory learning experience rather than a passive talk.
