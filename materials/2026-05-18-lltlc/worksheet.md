# **🧠 Mental Models**

## **1\. Theory of Mind for AI**

* The skill is social, not technical  
* Ask: "What context is the AI missing? What assumption is it making?"  
* Your job: be the bridge between your intent and AI's understanding

## **2\. Context Engineering \> Prompt Engineering**

* It's not about magic phrases — it's about what information you include  
* Make tacit knowledge explicit: course level/modality, purpose, constraints, what didn't work before

## **3\. The Three Stances**

* **Stance 1:** Don't know domain → can't tell garbage from gold  
* **Stance 2:** Know domain, resist adapting → only rote task savings  
* **Stance 3:** Know domain \+ collaborate creatively → **dramatic amplification**

## **4\. Architect, Not Coder**

You describe what you or your students need; AI builds it. Your expertise is in describing your intent well, not JavaScript or python. 

## **5\. Iterate, Don't Perfect**

First prompt/output won't be right — that's expected. Describe what's wrong with what you got.

# **🛠 Tools We're Using**

| Tool | Purpose | Link |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Excalidraw** | Sketch your idea visually | [excalidraw.com](https://excalidraw.com/) |
| **AI Studio** | Build it with AI | [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com) |
| **GitHub** *(optional)* | Save & publish live | [github.com](https://github.com) |

## Sketching Options (Pick One)

**Option A: Digital (Excalidraw)**
- Go to [excalidraw.com](https://excalidraw.com/)
- Sketch boxes, buttons, text
- Export as PNG for AI Studio

**Option B: Paper + Phone**
- Sketch on paper
- Take a photo with your phone
- Upload directly to AI Studio

**Option C: Screenshot + Remix (FASTEST)**
- Screenshot any website, PDF, or app you like
- Paste into Excalidraw (or upload directly)
- Add text annotations: "change this to X", "add Y here"
- Upload to AI Studio

> All three options work equally well — AI Studio accepts any image!

**Shared session:** Once you have something, share it in our shared Excalidraw:
> **Shared Excalidraw:** [[SHARED_EXCALIDRAW_LINK]]

**The Flow:** Sketch/screenshot → AI Studio Build mode → iterate → single HTML+JS page → (optional) GitHub Pages

# **💡 Build Session 1: Three Ways to Start**

## **Path 1: Screenshot + Remix (FASTEST)**
Best for: *"I want something like THIS but for MY class"*

1. Screenshot a website, PDF, or app you already like
2. Paste into Excalidraw (or upload directly to AI Studio)
3. Add text annotations: "change this to X", "make this do Y"
4. Upload to AI Studio

**Examples:** Screenshot a quiz tool, a scheduling page, a study app — then annotate what you'd change for your course.

---

## **Path 2: Pick a Template**
Best for: *"I know what I need"*

☐  **Vocabulary flashcards** — For any course; students can make their own too
☐  **Random student picker** — Fair participation (use fake names in demo)
☐  **Activity timer** — Transitions, group work, think-pair-share
☐  **Quick formative quiz** — Check understanding for a unit/module
☐  **Exit ticket** — What clicked? What's still fuzzy?
☐  **Learning objective tracker** — Students self-assess against outcomes

---

## **Path 3: Solve Your Pain Point**
Best for: *"I have a specific problem"*

Ask yourself:
- What takes too long every week?
- What do students struggle with?
- What's tedious or repetitive?

Then build THAT.

**Quick sketch checklist (60 seconds):**
1. Draw 3–5 big boxes (Header / Inputs / Actions / Output)
2. Label each box with short text
3. Add arrows for flow (input → action → output)
4. **Share to shared Excalidraw** and add your name!

# **🔨 Build Session 2: Prompts That Work**

### **Starting your build with** [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com)

**Steps:**
1. Go to [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com) (use personal Gmail if work account is blocked)
2. Click **"Build"** in the top menu
3. Export your Excalidraw sketch as PNG, or describe what you want
4. Paste the image or type your description
5. Iterate with follow-up messages!

**Starter prompt template:**

*"Build a \[tool type\] for \[course level / modality\] students that \[what it does\]. Include \[specific features\] and consider accessibility."*

### **Iteration prompts:**

* "Make the button bigger and more visible"  
* "Add a score counter in the top right"  
* "Change the color scheme to \[X\]"  
* "Make it work better on mobile/tablet"  
* "Add a reset button"  
* "The \[X\] isn't working — it should \[expected behavior\]"

### **When stuck:**

* Describe what you *see* vs. what you *expected*  
* Add context: "This is for a first-year course with varied preparation and accessibility needs"  
* Ask yourself: "What context is the AI missing?"

# **🚀 (Optional) Publishing to GitHub Pages**

*This step is optional — you can skip it and still have a working tool!*

**What you get:** A single HTML+JS page hosted **free forever** on GitHub Pages.

**Steps:**
1. In AI Studio, click the GitHub icon (top right)
2. Authorize your GitHub account
3. Create new repo: **course-tools**
4. Push your code
5. Go to github.com → your repo → Settings → Pages
6. Deploy from **main** branch
7. Wait 1-2 minutes
8. Your app is live at: **username.github.io/course-tools**

**Why single-page HTML+JS?**
- No server required
- Free hosting forever
- Shareable URL
- Works on any device

# **🎓 Teaching Students to Build**

Once you've built something yourself, consider having your students do the same!

### Why students should build:
- **Agency** — When students build their own study tools, they own their learning
- **Iteration** — "Fix what's wrong" beats "get it right the first time"
- **Curiosity** — "What else could I build?" is the question we want them asking

### Student-friendly project ideas:
- Flashcards for their own vocabulary/concepts
- A quiz to test themselves or classmates
- A study guide or review tool
- A timer for their own study sessions
- A "teach-back" tool to explain a concept

### Tips for course implementation:
1. **Start simple** — Pick ONE class session or module where students build instead of consume
2. **Model first** — Show them your own building process (including mistakes!)
3. **Embrace iteration** — Let them revise and improve
4. **Share outcomes** — Have students demo their tools to each other

*The same mental models apply: Theory of Mind, Context Engineering, Architect not Coder, Iterate don't Perfect*
