## Detailed Facilitator Guide

### 0:00-0:03 — Welcome & The Shift (3 min)

**Key message:** This is about a fundamental shift from teachers as content deliverers to teachers as builders.

**Say:**
> "Welcome everyone. Today's workshop is about a fundamental shift. By the end of this hour, you'll have built something real that you can use Monday morning."

**Show:** Yesterday vs Today comparison

---

### 0:03-0:07 — The Arc & Why Building Works (4 min)

**Key message:** You become builders → You teach building → Students become creators

**Emphasize the quote:**
> "Not by banning AI, but by making creation the default."

**Three principles to highlight:**
1. **Agency** — ownership drives engagement
2. **Iteration** — attempt → feedback → refinement
3. **Curiosity** — building sparks real questions

---

### 0:07-0:15 — Mental Models (8 min)

**This is the conceptual foundation. Don't rush.**

**Key concepts:**
1. **Theory of Mind for AI** — "What false assumption is the AI making?"
2. **Context Engineering** — It's about what info you include, not clever phrasing
3. **The Three Stances** — Move them to Stance 3 (domain expert + creative collaboration)
4. **Architect, Not Coder** — "Never let 'I can't code' stop you"
5. **Iterate, Don't Perfect** — First prompt won't be right, that's expected

**Bridge example to use:**
> "If I ask AI to 'make a quiz for my students,' it doesn't know their reading level, what we just covered, whether it's formative or summative, or that half my class are ELL students."

---

### 0:15-0:18 — Live Demo (3 min)

**Show 1-2 pre-built artifacts:**
- Walk through the prompt evolution
- Show how iteration improved the result
- Keep it quick — they'll learn by doing

---

### 0:18-0:22 — Your Tools (4 min)

**The flow:**
1. **tldraw** (makereal.tldraw.com) — Sketch your idea
2. **AI Studio** (aistudio.google.com) — Make it real
3. **GitHub** — Save and publish

**Have them open tldraw NOW:**
> "Open makereal.tldraw.com right now. Don't wait."

---

### 0:22-0:30 — BUILD SESSION 1: Brainstorm (8 min)

**⏱️ Set a visible timer**

**Project options:**
- Vocabulary flashcards
- Random name picker
- Classroom timer
- Quick quiz (5 Q's)
- Exit ticket collector
- "Would you rather?"
- Or their own idea

**Circulate and help:**
- "Ugly is fine — the AI will make it pretty"
- "Just sketch boxes and buttons"
- "Don't overthink — you can always build more later"

**At 7 min:** "One more minute to wrap up your sketch!"

---

### 0:30-0:50 — BUILD SESSION 2: Make It Real (20 min)

**⏱️ Set a visible timer**

**Instructions:**
1. Export tldraw as PNG (or just describe it)
2. Open aistudio.google.com → Build mode
3. Paste image or describe what you want
4. Iterate!

**Iteration prompts to suggest:**
- "Make the button bigger"
- "Add a score counter"
- "Change colors to match my school"
- "Make it work on mobile"

**Circulate and coach:**
- Remind them of Theory of Mind: "What context is the AI missing?"
- Encourage iteration: "What's wrong with it? Tell the AI."
- Celebrate progress: "That's working! What's next?"

**Time checks:**
- At 10 min: "Halfway! How's everyone doing?"
- At 15 min: "5 more minutes!"
- At 18 min: "Start wrapping up — get it to a good stopping point"

---

### 0:50-0:55 — The Multiplier & For Students (5 min)

**Key message:** Scale the impact

**Say:**
> "You just built something in an hour. Now imagine your students doing this. If you teach 30 students to be builders, and each creates one tool, that's 30 new learning resources that didn't exist before."

**Same principles apply to students:**
- Agency → they own their learning
- Iteration → "fix what's wrong" beats "get it right first time"
- Curiosity → "what else could I build?"

---

### 0:55-0:58 — For Teachers & Resources (3 min)

**Commitment:**
> "Pick ONE lesson in the next 2 weeks where students BUILD instead of consume."

**Right now actions:**
1. Find an accountability partner (turn to someone near you)
2. Post your app URL in the shared doc

**Resources:**
- makereal.tldraw.com
- aistudio.google.com
- AI Studio → App Gallery
- grow.google/ai-for-educators

---

### 0:58-1:00 — Exit Ticket & Close (2 min)

**Three questions:**
1. 💡 One thing that clicked
2. ❓ One thing still fuzzy
3. 🚀 What will you build in the next 2 weeks?

**Close with:**
> "Now go build something. Thank you for being here today. I can't wait to see what you create — and what your students create after you teach them."

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Participant stuck on tldraw | "Just draw boxes and labels — ugly is fine" |
| AI Studio not working | Try describing instead of image upload |
| "I don't know what to build" | Suggest classroom timer or name picker |
| Running behind | Cut demo time, extend build time |
| Running ahead | Add share-out time at end |
