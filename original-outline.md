## Building to Learn
### Learning to Build
@vishalsachdev

Welcome everyone. Today's workshop is about a fundamental shift - from teachers as content deliverers to teachers as builders. By the end of the session, you'll have built something real that you can use later.

---

## The Shift

### YESTERDAY
- Assessments AI can game
- Teachers deliver content
- Students consume
- Shrinking attention spans

### TODAY
- Projects requiring agency
- Teachers BUILD tools
- Students CREATE
- Curiosity & ownership

Here's the problem we're solving. Traditional assessments? AI can game them. Students consuming content? Their attention spans are shrinking. We need a new paradigm where teachers build tools for their specific context, and students become creators, not consumers.

---

## The Arc

🔧  
**You become builders**  
→  

🎓  
**You teach building**  
→  

🚀  
**Students become creators**

"Not by banning AI, but by making creation the default."

This is the arc of today. First, YOU become builders. You'll leave with a working tool. Then you take this back and teach your students to build. When students create their own learning tools, engagement transforms. This isn't about banning AI - it's about making creation the default.

---

## Why Building Works

### Agency
Ownership over what you make drives engagement

### Iteration
Learning happens through attempt → feedback → refinement

### Curiosity
Building something real sparks questions worksheets never will

Why does building work pedagogically? Three principles. **AGENCY** - when you own what you make, you're invested. **ITERATION** - learning happens through attempt, feedback, refinement cycles. **CURIOSITY** - building something real sparks questions that worksheets never will. These apply to you today AND to your students when you teach them.

## PART 1
## Mental Models
**How to think about working with AI**

Now let's talk about HOW to work with AI effectively. These mental models will serve you far beyond today.

---

> "The skill that makes you great at AI isn't technical.  
> It's social."
> — Riedl & Weidmann, "Quantifying Human-AI Synergy" (2025)

This quote comes from a 2025 research paper. The researchers found something surprising - the skill that makes you great at AI isn't technical. It's social. It's about perspective-taking.

---

## Theory of Mind for AI

Your capacity to model another agent's beliefs, goals, and perspective.

When you get a bad response, ask:
- "What false assumption is the AI making?"
- "What context am I taking for granted?"

**Your job is to be the bridge:** Intent <-----> AI's understanding

Theory of Mind is your capacity to model what another agent knows, believes, and needs. When you get a bad AI response, don't just rephrase. Ask: What false assumption is the AI making? What context am I taking for granted that it doesn't have? YOUR JOB IS TO BE THE BRIDGE between your intent and the AI's understanding.

---

> "If I ask AI to 'make a quiz for my students,' it doesn't know their reading level, what we just covered, whether it's formative or summative, or that half my class are ELL students. My job is to be the bridge — to translate my tacit knowledge into explicit context."

---

## Theory of Mind → Context Engineering

**PROMPT ENGINEERING to CONTEXT ENGINEERING**

- Prompt engineering sounds like wordsmithing — finding the magic phrase, the clever trick
- Context engineering is about what information you include, not how cleverly you phrase it
- You don't need to learn prompting. You need to make your tacit knowledge explicit

So if the skill is recognizing what context the AI is missing, the next question is: how do you actually provide that context? This is where we shift from 'prompt engineering' to 'context engineering.

## The Three Stances

- **Don't know the domain** → AI gives garbage mixed with gold, can't tell which
- **Know domain, resist adapting** → Only get time savings on rote tasks
- **Know domain + collaborate creatively** → DRAMATIC amplification

Ben Goertzel - an AI researcher - describes three stances people take. Stance 1: You don't know the domain, so AI outputs garbage mixed with gold and you can't tell which is which. Stance 2: You know your domain but resist adapting - you only get time savings on rote tasks. Stance 3: You know your domain AND collaborate creatively - that's where dramatic amplification happens. You are domain experts in learning. Today we move you to Stance 3.

---

## Architect, Not Coder

You describe what you/students need.  
The AI builds it.  
Your expertise is pedagogy, not HTML/JavaScript.

Mental model 3: You're the architect, not the coder. You describe what students need. The AI builds it. Your expertise is pedagogy, not JavaScript. Never let 'I can't code' stop you.

---

## Iterate, Don't Perfect

Get prompt perfect first time  
→  

Describe what's wrong

Your first prompt won't be right. That's expected.

Mental model 4: Iterate, don't perfect. Your first prompt won't be right - that's expected and fine. Don't try to craft the perfect prompt. Instead, describe what's wrong with what you got. This is exactly how professionals work with AI.

## LIVE DEMO
## Examples
**Mental models in action**

Now let me show you these mental models in action with some examples I've built. [FACILITATOR: Demo your 2-3 pre-built artifacts here, showing the prompt evolution for each]

## PART 2
## Your Tools
**tldraw → Google AI Studio**

Let's talk about the tools you'll use today.

---

## The Flow

### STEP 1
### tldraw
**Sketch your idea**
- Low stakes
- Visual brainstorm
- makereal.tldraw.com

→  

### STEP 2
### AI Studio
**Make it real**
- Iterate with chat
- See live preview
- aistudio.google.com

### STEP 3
### GitHub
**Save your work**
- Publish live
- Build portfolio
- github.com

Here's the flow: tldraw for brainstorming - it's low stakes, you're just sketching. Then AI Studio Build Mode to make it real. Finally GitHub to save your work and publish it live. Each step has a specific purpose.

---

## tldraw: Sketch First

- Lowers the "blank page" problem
- You're drawing, not coding
- Sketch boxes, buttons, text. Ugly is fine.
- Share with others
  - Invite by email, publish online, export PNG

**Open now:**  
makereal.tldraw.com

tldraw solves the blank page problem. You're drawing, not coding. Sketch boxes, buttons, text areas. Ugly is fine - the AI will make it pretty. You can invite collaborators by email, publish online, or export as PNG. Open it now: makeitreal.tldraw.com

---

## BUILD SESSION 1
## Brainstorm
**in tldraw**
**10 minutes**

Time to build! This first session is about brainstorming in tldraw. You have 25 minutes.

---

## Pick One to Build

- Vocabulary flashcards
- Random name picker
- Classroom timer
- Quick quiz (5 Q's)
- Exit ticket collector
- "Would you rather?"
- Or... solve your own time challenge from this morning

Pick one of these to build - or solve your own time challenge from this morning. All of these are achievable in our time together. Don't overthink the choice - you can always build more later.

---

## BUILD SESSION 2
## Make It Real
**in AI Studio**
**15 minutes**

Now we take your sketches and make them real. 40 minutes in AI Studio.

---

## AI Studio: Build Mode

- Export tldraw sketch as PNG (or describe it)
- Open aistudio.google.com → Build mode
- Paste image or describe what you want
- Iterate: "Make the button bigger" / "Add a score counter" / "Add AI features"

Here's the workflow: Export your tldraw as PNG, or just describe it. Open aistudio.google.com and go to Build mode. Paste the image or describe what you want. Then iterate - ask for changes in plain English.

---

## Remember: Iterate

Try saying:
- "Make the button bigger"
- "Add a score counter"
- "Change colors to match my school"
- "Make it work on mobile"

**THEORY OF MIND CHECK**
- "What context is the AI missing?"
- "What assumption is it making?"

Remember the mental models as you iterate. Try phrases like 'Make the button bigger' or 'Add a score counter.' When something isn't working, ask yourself: What context is the AI missing? What assumption is it making? Be the bridge.

## CLOSING
## What's Next

Let's bring it home.

---

## The Multiplier

You just built something in an hour



Now imagine your students doing this.

If you teach  
30 students to be builders,
and …..




You built something real in 2 hours that works Monday. Now scale this thinking. If you teach 30 students to be builders, and each creates one tool, that's 30 new learning resources that didn't exist before - created by the people who need them most.

---

## Same Principles, For Students

### Agency
When you build your own study tools, they own their learning

### Iteration
"Fix what's wrong" beats "get it right the first time"

### Curiosity
"What else could I build?" — the question we want you asking

The same three principles apply when you teach students. Agency - when they build their own study tools, they own their learning. Iteration - 'fix what's wrong' is a better lesson than 'get it right first time.' Curiosity - 'what else could I build?' is the question we want them asking.
